You consume a lot of shallow content daily, mostly on social media.

This is not what your mind is made up for. It's not what you are made up for.

But, that's exactly what many people choose to do. They consume loads of shallow stuff by browsing social media day in, and day out. 

A typical social media feed is mostly shallow content - low-quality and low-value content. That's no coincidence. Out of the people who post on social media, many do not take the time or the effort to produce something of quality or value.

Consuming such content is like eating fast food. It's tasty and easy to consume but not healthy. It does not let your mind the slightest chance to dive deep. 

If you continuously consume such shallow content, shallow thinking begins to occupy your mind. Like moss on water, it will clog the natural flow of your mind.

Over time, the mind gets used to consuming shallow content without attempting depth. Like you cannot see the depth in moss-covered water the mind will fail to grasp stuff at depth. 

Long-form reading is quite the opposite of shallow content consumption. Reading long form lets your mind absorb a series of interrelated information. This is like taking your time to eat a healthy meal. Each consecutive information piece lets the mind dive deeper. 

Trained in this type of long-form reading over time, the mind tends to seek depth. It's like you can see the depth in water when there's no moss.

This is what your mind is made up for.

All the people who have made a lasting impact in the world, have done so by seeking depth. Their actions have always been formulated by deep thinking. So, if you too want to make a positive impact you'd better train your mind to seek depth.

So how should I get on with seeking depth?

Stop consuming shallow content. Social media is a prominent source of shallow content. But there are newspapers, television channels, radio channels, and also people who pour out a copious amount of shallow content daily. Shut those sources off your life immediately. 

Shutting them off creates a void in your thinking. You must fill this void with reading long-form content; quality books, articles, etc.

Consuming long-form content allows your mind to go deep. But, reading, particularly long-form reading is not easy for someone who is not used to it. 

So, you are likely to struggle with reading from the very first page you try.

Now what?

Start writing. (Yes. you read it right.)

But isn't writing harder than reading?

OK. Writing is not necessarily hard. What really hard is public writing. If you are to publish your writing, you must do a lot of polishing and it's a lot of hard work.

Start by writing to yourself instead. Writing to yourself is also known as journaling. You write down your thoughts, feelings, experiences, and observations.

Journaling is not demanding like public writing. There's no strain on quality or quantity. You can write as little as you feel or as much as you want. Spelling, grammar... who cares? You can refine your writing whenever you want.

So, if you want to quit consuming shallow content but still find that long-form reading is hard, start writing a journal. 

There's no wrong way to journaling. You can use a notebook and a pencil, or a note-taking app on your laptop. You can do it in the morning as the first thing you do every day or at night as the last thing before bed.

The most important thing is that you journal as a habit. Once your journaling habit materializes, you will find it easier to take up long-form reading. 

In the 21st century, where knowledge no longer matters, long-form reading is of paramount importance. It shapes your mind's ability to deep thinking.  

Once your mind gets into deep thinking, the shallow content will be just as boring and the mind will crave depth.

So why would you fill up your mind with shallow stuff?
