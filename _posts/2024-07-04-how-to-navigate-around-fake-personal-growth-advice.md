Gold is valuable because it's scarce.

Two reasons can diminish the value of gold. The first is the abundance of gold. The second is the ample availability of fake gold - a metal that looks and feels like gold but is not actually gold.

If a fake gold material comes about some day, we will have a hard time differentiating real gold from fake gold. 

This is what's happening with personal growth advice. 

With unprecedented interest in personal growth, lots and lots of personal growth advice is becoming available on blogs, podcasts, and many social media platforms. 

Some of this advice comes from experts who have actually achieved certain goals, and have a genuine interest in helping others also achieve similar goals. 

But there's also a bunch of fake experts who imitate success and claim things that, they have never achieved. These guys pretend to help you in your personal growth journey but, they are just after your money.

Consider this popular advice offering in the personal growth market - turn your passion into a 6-figure business.

Indeed, there are people who have turned their passions into successful businesses. They can teach you what they have practically learned during that process, and help you also turn your passion into a successful business.

But not everyone is not so truthy. A bunch of fake gurus are offering to teach you to turn your passion into a successful business - a goal they have not achieved themselves. These fake gurus do not have first-hand experience in building a business but are just trying to make money by selling you fake advice via coaching, workshops, etc.

Unless you are a seasoned internet entrepreneur who has toiled through thick and thin and has built a successful business yourself, you will not be able to distinguish what is real advice for building a 6-figure business.

But, personal growth is real. Many people have incorporated personal growth advice into their lives and have met with success. So, we all are also apt to be like them.

But, we are at a loss because we cannot distinguish the real advice from the fake. If we follow advice from a fake guru we may end up losing our money and wasting our effort. 

However, whether coming from a real or a fake guru, personal growth advice is not guaranteed to generate results.

You may follow the advice from a genuine internet entrepreneur but you may still fail to build a 6-figure business because things are not the same anymore.

The market may have transformed. Competition is different. Opportunities are not the same anymore. Your circumstances are different. A zillion things could be different in your context when compared to the situation of the person you are receiving advice from.

So, even real advice from genuine people is not guaranteed to work for your specific case. And if you choose to follow fake advice, getting results is beneath consideration anyway.

So, whatever advice you choose to follow you need a **measurement system**. 

A sprinter training for the Olympics must have a measurement system. He or she must measure timing every day. If timing is not improving he or she must alter the course of action, like changing the workout, changing the diet, etc. The measurement system is the key that gives the sprinter feedback that he or she is on the correct path.

Similarly, following personal growth advice to achieve your life goals, you must have a measurement system. 

The measurement system allows you to measure how each action is taking you closer to the goal. If an action is not helping you move closer to the goal, you must identify it and change the course of action.

Your measurement system is the key that enables you to experiment, learn, and correct your actions as you work hard towards your goals.

Creating a measurement system for a life goal is complicated. There's no tried and tested way to create such a measurement system due to the subtle differences in circumstances and goals of each person.

It's up to you to create your measurement system and actually use it to measure your progress.

Your personal growth depends on that.
