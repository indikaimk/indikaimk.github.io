Gold is scarce.

Its scarcity is what makes gold valuable.

Two reasons can diminish the value of gold. The first is the abundant availability of gold itself. The second is the abudant availability of a different metal that looks and behaves like gold but lacks some key, hard to distinguish characteristics of gold.

If the second thing actually materializes we all will have a hard time differentiating real gold from this fake material. 

This is what's really happening in personal growth advice. 

Persoanl growth is as old as the history. But today there's an unwarranted interest in personal growth.

A ton of content is being created on blogs, podcasts, and multitude of socila media platforms about the topic. The topics varies but revolve around health, wealth, and relationships with others.

Some of these advices are coming from people who have actually achieved what they claim and have the genuine interest in to help others. BUt not all. There are more people who imitate success and claim things that they have never achieved. What they are trying to do is just to make money by selling some fake advice on personal growth.


Consider this popular claim of turning your passsion into a 7-figure income.

Indeed, there are people who have successfully converted their passion to a business. They can teach you what they have practically learns and help you to turn your passion to a successfule business.

The other set of fake coaches have not successfully done so, but claim to teach you the same thing. They will also have coursed, books, workshops, etc created from their speculations.

Now, it's practically impossible to distinguish between these two groups, unless you are a seasoned internet entrpreneur who has gone through the thick and thin of such a process. Even by analyzing their advice, you will not be able to distinguish which one is right.

But, personal growth is real and there are countless number of people who have improved their life by integrating person growth.

But if I cannot distinguis the real from fake it's impossible.

The truth is whether the advice is coming from a real or a fake person, none of it's guaranteed to work for you.

You may follow the advice of a genuine internet enterpreneur who has successfully turned their passion into income and has created a systme whihc you can follow to do the same.

That system is not guaranteed to work fr you.

Things have changed with time. While the system that they teach you had astounding success on that person, it's not guaranteed to work for you because the things are not the same anymore. The market has changed, peoples thinknig patterns have changed, the competition has doouble etc.

If you choose to follow a fake, nothing to say, but his sytem may or may not work for you.

Whatever the group you choose to follow, you must experiment a lot. There's going to be a lot of hands on learning in any personal growth aspect.

Keep learning and keep trying untl you crack. Fail fast. If things do not work out check what;s not working. 

Then the key problem becomes how do we identify fail scenario. 

We need to have a system to measure.

An athlete has a time goal. He should be able to hit 11s in one month. He will keep stop watch and note the time every day. He will then plot the tiem each day and can get an indication will he be able to avaive his goal by the end of the month.

If he cannot he has to alter the strategy, like increasing the practicing time or changing the practicing method, change his diet, etc. 

Simiolarly you need a system to measure your performance and give you an indication of where you are in terms of yur goal. 

But in real life measuring may not be as straightforward as for an athlete. A goal such as bulding a seven-figure businees is especially complicated. 

The varety of goals and the variety of paths people choose make it impossible to create a unified system to measure.

It's up to you to create your measurement system.

Your success depedns on that

How successful you get depends on how you measure your performance.

The shrt term objectives are easy to measure. The long term objectives are not so obvious. 

Fail fast does not mean giving up. Find out what is not working and correct.








So, is personal development impossible? Should i just accept things as they are and stay dong wha tever I can to keep going?

Not really. 

Personal growth is a real thing. You can turn your passion into an income. You can be wealthy.
