A ship sailing in the river to a destination port.

The sailor or the coxwain must target the destination port. There can be beautiful scenaries alongside the riverbanks.

The sailor can briefly stop and enjoy the scenaries. But doing so will delay him from reaching the destination. So he must keep pushing till he reach the destined port. Beyond the destined port, the river stretch far. The sailor can sail even beyond the destination port if he wish to do so. But that's against the plan.

So what is important is to create the correct plan and stick to it. If the plan is to be chaged, there is a price to be paid. So change the plan only if you are ready to pay the price.

Once you start sailing, it's like you cannot stop, until you reach the destination. Or you'll be caught up in the scenary and will loose.

Some of the scenary is illusions. They look bright and nice from the distance. but hard to survive if you are to land. No food, no shelter, can hardly survive. 

Just look, see it and move. Do not stop to watch or try to acquire. There is no truth in an illusion.

Just llok at the beautiful scenary from the corner of your eyes and keep sailig. How aggresive you sail determines how quickly you reach the destination port. But too much aggresive could harm you. Be aggresive enough so you keep going against the current.

If you are too aggresive you could miss somethings along the way. Just get the glimpse fo things arond and keep going for your destination.
