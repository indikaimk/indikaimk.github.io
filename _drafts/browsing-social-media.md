Why would you need to fill your mind with worthless shallow stuff when it's much better be filled with deep stuff. 

You are consuming a lot of shallow content when you are browsing social media. This is not worth. It's not what the mind is made for. And it's not what you are made for. 

But, that's what actually many do. They fill their minds with a bunch of shallow stuff from other people by browsing social media every day, or every hour for some people. 

A social media feed consists of a series of shallow content created by a bunch of people out of which many did not take the time or the effort to produce something of quality or vlaue. 

Browsing social media means is going throuhgh a lot of shallow stuff. which is not worth. your brian get filled with shallow stuff and get clogged/

long foem reading make your mind deeper and let it hold a few core deep concets. mind does not get clogged. 

It has become a norm for ordinary people to go through the social media on a daily basis. some even eery hour. their belief is that it's taking a break from the hard work whatever thay've been doing. whether it's writing sales letters or writing code, or moving crates. 

But is it really taking a brake.

wha t happens your brain when you get to consule a series of discontinued pieces of information. Each piece is interesting just becaese it's easy to consume - like fast food. But each consecutive piece replace the previous and the mind does not get the chace to dig deep in any piece.

Then the mind get clogged holding on to so much information at shallow. It blunts the ability to think and go deep in any matter. When the mind gets trained like this fro a long time. 

Deep reading is quite the opposite. It let the mind abosrn a series of information that are related. This is like eating a healthy meal. Each consecutive piece of information let the mind dive deeper. When trained like this for a long time the mind can get deep and hold a few deep concept s. Not clogged with little bits and pirece of informattion. 

The great minds of this world have been thinkers. They have changed the world by thinking deep and putting their thoughts into actions. The shallow minded people will never make this kind of impact on the world.

So how should I get on with practicig deep mind. 

Stop consuming short bits of shallow pieces in socia media. For the matter on any media. Socual media is the prominene type of meid that has truckloads of this kind of pieces of information. But there could be newspapers, television channels, radio channels or even people who continupusely pour out this kind of information. Shut those media immediately from your life. 

Practing to go deep is not easy. Especially reading is not easy for a person who is not used to readi. If you do not fill the void of the social media it will get filled with something.

So if you find reading hard enough at the beginning do waht?

Start writing.

Not publishing a nice blog. If you start like that it will never materialize. Start by journaling in a notebook with a pencil. In the previpus generation called this writign a diary. And many a great men did that.

While a Diary is considered private, there are many diarie shtat wer later published and revealed wonferful stories ot the world. 

So, if you want to quit social media and stop consuming shallow conten and still find it hard to do deep reading, try writing a journal. 

If you think notebook and pencils is not your taste, you can use a laptop and some notetaking software like OneNote, Evernote, Notion, etc. But if you think that notebooks and pecnils are not for you but have never tried it, I urge you to try that option. It's not expensive. Perhanps you may find everthing you need right onlyour desk right now. 

Just try to do it and discover yourself whehter it workd for you or not. Perhanps you may find it quite joyful to hear the pencil crushing the tiny parts of the paper. For some of you it may be the first tim after primary school they get this type of experiecne. Neverthless it's worht th try.
